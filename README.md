# Proof-of-Concept Post-Quantum Secure LM Interactions

> Note: Do NOT use in production!

This is the simple codebase of a proof-of-concept model for secure LM interactions. Please check out the report for full details! Note that this was essentially an addendum to the security analysis; this could be a cool area to spin an entire project off of entirely!

To execute, you will need Python 3.8 or Python 3.9, Sagemath, concrete-ml, and transformers.

```
python3 src/lm_interactive.py
```
